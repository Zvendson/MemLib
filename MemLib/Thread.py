"""
Windows thread abstraction and control utilities.

This module provides a `Thread` class for managing Windows thread handles, priorities, suspension,
resumption, and joining, as well as a `Priority` enum with typical Windows thread priority values.

Features:
    * Open, close, suspend, resume, join, and terminate threads
    * Get/set thread priority with error handling
    * Context manager support for thread handle lifetime
    * Comparison by thread/process identity

Warning:
    Do not instantiate `Thread` directlyâ€”use the corresponding methods of the `Process` class to retrieve Thread objects.

Example:
    # Retrieve Thread objects via process.GetThreads() or similar.
